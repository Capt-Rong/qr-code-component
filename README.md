## What I've learned

Through this challenge, I practiced:

- Structuring a basic HTML card component
- Centering content with Flexbox
- Using `max-width` to create responsive card sizes
- Applying Google Fonts and custom color themes
- Upload the files in github repo


## Continued Development

In the future, I might:

- Add animations or hover effects
- Make it theme-switchable (dark/light)
- Use typescript, tailwind and react to rebuild


## Get Started
To run this project locally:

```bash
